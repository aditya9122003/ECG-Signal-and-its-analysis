# ECG-Signal-and-its-analysis
Digital Signal Processing Project

Members: Karthikeya, Shashank, Aditya

By this project we intend to analyze the ECG signal. We design a system to calculate the plot for heart rate and breath rate.

The report is available as "ECG signal analysis file". 

In this project, we got a chance to use the AD8232 sensor. With a error of just 2 BPM, it places itself on a better position than a variety of other sensors. 
Our main 2 aims were to calculate heart rate and breath rate using ECG. To calculate the heart rate, we recorded the time between 2 successive R-waves in the ECG plot obtained. (The ECG plot is made up of several ECG plots, more about it in the report). 
In order to calculate breath rate, we aimed to check the difference in breath rate before and after exercising. From that we did the required analysis.
